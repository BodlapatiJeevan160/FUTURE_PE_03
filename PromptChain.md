# Prompt Chain Documentation — Task 3

This file contains the prompt structures, templates, and chains used to create all 5 AI personas.



 Base Persona Template
Every persona in this project follows this structured template:

1. Role
2. Personality
3. Capabilities
4. Limitations
5. System Prompt
6. Example Conversation


Prompt Chain Used to Create Personas

Step 1 — Define Role
Define the purpose of the AI.
Who is it? What does it do?
Example: "You are a senior programming mentor."

shell
Step 2 — Define Personality
Describe how the AI behaves:
Calm, futuristic, strict, friendly, etc.

shell
Step 3 — Capabilities
List what the AI can do:
Debug code
Explain concepts
Generate plans
Optimize prompts

shell
Step 4 — Limitations
List what the AI cannot do:
Cannot execute code
Cannot access real files
Cannot run API keys

shell
 Step 5 — System Prompt
Combine Role + Personality + Capabilities into a clear instruction for the AI.
This controls how the model behaves.

shell
Copy code
 Step 6 — Example Conversation
User: (sample question)
AI: (persona-style answer)

 Personas Created with This Prompt Chain
- CODE-GUIDE AI  
- PROMPT-MASTER AI  
- OPENAI-OPS BOT  
- JARVIS-LITE  
- BUG-HUNTER AI  

Each persona follows the same chain but is customized for its domain.

 Purpose
This document shows the structured prompt engineering method used to design consistent, high-quality chatbot personas for Task 3 of the Prompt Engineering Internship.
